Before receiving the code, we ensure that the APIs worked correctly when deployed to AWS .

For Deploying Part Of Frontend .....

>>Step 1:We will build the code...How??

Build Process:
# npm install -g @angular/cli
# ng version
# ng build --configuration production
After the build process, the code will be in the folder under this path.( dist/your-project-name)

>>Step 2 : Install Web Server On EC2 ( This Commands For Amazon Linux 2023 ) 
# sudo dnf update -y 
# sudo dnf install -y nginx
# sudo systemctl start nginx 
# sudo systemctl enable nginx ( If Status is an active , than Web Server is Running Correctly ) 
# sudo systemctl status nginx
# nginx -v

>>Step 3 : Install Nodejs Packages 

Note : Use nvm instead of installing directly via dnf to avoid problems.

# curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
# export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
# nvm --version
# nvm install node
# node -v ( The version should appear )
# npm -v (The version should appear)

>>Step 4 : Transfer Build File to EC2 ( Any Way ) 

We Used FileZilla Program to Transfer process ( Build File of Frontend Must be here on EC2 ( /usr/share/nginx/html ) 

# Cd /usr/share/nginx/html
# sudo rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*
# unzip you-dist-file.zip ( Prefer tranfer Build File ( .Zip )
# sudo systemctl restart nginx

After This Step Frontend should open
